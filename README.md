# One Of My Favorite Hobbies Webpage
This webpage is about one of my favorite hobbies, which is making YouTube Videos. There is information about my youtube channel, popularity of making youtube channels and subscriber counts of channels, why I do it, and what I plan to accomplish with my YouTube Channel.
## How to Use
There are menu buttons on the top of the page which will scroll you to what it refers to. 
## I need or want more information about how to use this, the roadmap, or more information.
You can go to the wiki for that information.

This will be explained in more detail on the wiki just in case you don't get it, but on the bottom right corner of the "Code" page, there is an "Environments" section and under that there is a "github-pages" entry. Click that and click the most recent one to go onto the site.
