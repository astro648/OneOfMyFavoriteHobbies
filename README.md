# One Of My Favorite Hobbies Webpage
This webpage is about one of my favorite hobbies, which is making YouTube Videos.
## How to Use
There are menu buttons on the top of the page which will scroll you to what it refers to. (Will be added in one of the next phases)
## Q&A
#### Why did you make this?
I made this as a practice website and also to show why I like making YouTube Videos.
#### How did you make this?
I used Brackets as the IDE and HTML, CSS, and JS as the coding languages to make this. I also used some online tools for some parts of this.
#### Where can I learn coding?
There are many places to learn coding, but generally, if you want to pursue coding, I would recommend finding a teacher or class to learn coding.
## Why I Used Brackets IDE To Develop This
I used Brackets IDE to develop this because it is simple and easy to use. Unfortunately, Adobe is stopping support for it at September, but people are probably going to revive it by making forks of it.
